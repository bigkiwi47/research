This github repository is a collection of code I either created or was inspired by/found interesting over the course of the last couple of months during my time going through this course.

A lot of these codes helped me to construct my software development assignment, whether it be thinking of new ways to construct my menu or just simple functions to use to try and make my code run smoother.
